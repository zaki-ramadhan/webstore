          <p>Welcome to <strong>{{ config('app.name') }}</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”). These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our website, including browsing the product catalog, placing orders, using the shopping cart and checkout, and tracking orders (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

          <h3>1. Eligibility & Account</h3>
          <p>You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, to make a purchase. You may check out as a guest or create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities under your account.</p>

          <h3>2. Products, Pricing & Availability</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Product descriptions, images, and specifications are provided for guidance and may differ slightly from the actual item. Colors may vary due to display settings.</li>
            <li>Prices, discounts, and availability are subject to change at any time without notice. A product being in your cart does not reserve the price or stock.</li>
            <li>We may limit quantities per order, per customer, or per household to prevent abuse or reselling.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Orders & Acceptance</h3>
          <p>After you place an order, you will receive an order confirmation. This confirmation acknowledges receipt of your order but does not constitute our acceptance. We reserve the right to accept or decline your order for any reason (including suspected fraud, stock issues, or pricing errors). If we must cancel all or part of your order, we will notify you and issue a refund for any amounts charged.</p>

          <h3>4. Payment</h3>
          <p>We accept the payment methods shown during checkout. By submitting payment information, you represent that you are authorized to use the selected method and authorize us (and our payment processors) to charge the full order amount, including any shipping, handling, and applicable taxes.</p>

          <h3>5. Shipping, Delivery & Risk of Loss</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Estimated delivery dates are provided for convenience and are not guaranteed. Delays may occur due to carrier issues, customs, or factors outside our control.</li>
            <li>Risk of loss and title transfer to you upon delivery to the carrier (or as otherwise required by applicable law).</li>
            <li>Please ensure your shipping address is accurate; we are not responsible for deliveries to an incorrect address provided by you.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>6. Returns & Refunds</h3>
          <p>If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may request a return within <strong>7 days</strong> of delivery for eligible items that are unused, in original condition, and with all packaging included. Some items (e.g., perishable goods, personalized items, and certain hygiene products) are non-returnable unless defective. Digital goods and downloaded items are non-refundable once delivered or accessed. Approved returns will be refunded to the original payment method, less any shipping fees unless the return is due to our error or a confirmed defect. To start a return, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@webstore.test">support@webstore.test</a> with your order number.</p>

          <h3>7. Promotions, Coupons & Gift Cards</h3>
          <p>Promotional codes and gift cards are subject to their stated terms and may not be combined unless expressly allowed. We may modify or cancel promotions at any time.</p>

          <h3>8. User Content & Reviews</h3>
          <p>If you submit reviews, comments, or other content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, and display that content in connection with the Services. You are solely responsible for your submissions and must not post unlawful, misleading, defamatory, or infringing content.</p>

          <h3>9. Acceptable Use</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Do not misuse the Services, attempt to interfere with their proper working, or access them using a method other than the interfaces we provide.</li>
            <li>Do not engage in scraping, automated data collection, or any activity that imposes an unreasonable load on our infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Do not attempt to bypass security features or use the Services for fraud or any unlawful purpose.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>10. Intellectual Property</h3>
          <p>All content on the website—including text, graphics, logos, product images, and UI components—is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not use our trademarks or branding without prior written permission.</p>

          <h3>11. Privacy</h3>
          <p>Your use of the Services is also governed by our Privacy Notice, which explains how we collect, use, and share personal information. By using the Services, you consent to our data practices as described there.</p>

          <h3>12. Third-Party Services</h3>
          <p>We may integrate third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, shipping carriers, analytics). Your use of those services may be subject to the third party’s own terms and policies. We are not responsible for third-party acts or omissions.</p>

          <h3>13. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
          <p>The Services and all products are provided “as is” and “as available” to the fullest extent permitted by law. We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties; these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

          <h3>14. Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits or revenues, arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Services or products, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event will our aggregate liability exceed the amount you paid for the product(s) giving rise to the claim.</p>

          <h3>15. Indemnification</h3>
          <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and our affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Services or your breach of these Terms.</p>

          <h3>16. Changes to the Services or Terms</h3>
          <p>We may modify the Services or these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Published” date above and, where appropriate, provide additional notice. Your continued use of the Services after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

          <h3>17. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Indonesia, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. Any dispute shall be resolved by the competent courts located in Indonesia, unless mandatory consumer protection laws provide otherwise.</p>
